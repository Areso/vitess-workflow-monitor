# Vitess-workflow-monitor  
![demo.png](demo.png)  
Small application to track workflow status, tested on Linux/GNOME/GTK
Most likely, with small workaround, will work with other OS as well.  
🟢 Green icon shows replication in `Copying`/`Running`  
🔴 Red icon shows replication in `Error` state  
Also, by click, you could see TPS (transaction per second) rate of applying binlogs  
Shows the stats in `shard: TPS` format.  
## Install requirements
`sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
also, on Ubuntu with GNOME, you probably will need appindicator.  
`sudo apt install gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1`  
in case of Arch your package would be named `libappindicator-gtk3`
## To start:  
`python3 moveworkflowmon.py`  
or  
`python3 moveworkflowmon.py --workflow testdb.move2vitess`,  
where `testdb` is a keyspace name and `move2vitess` is workflow name
